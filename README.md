# Indian Ocean High Seas Conservation Planning

MPA design using the R package 'prioritizr' for spatial optimization. 

This work is based on the Systematic Conservation Planning approach, and optimizes MPA design
to minimize conflicts with the fishing, shipping and deep-sea mining industries simultaneously. This offers two main advantages:
- a more efficient implementation of the protected areas
- comprehensive protection against cumulative negative human impacts on marine ecosystems

You will need to have an external solver, such as Gurobi.
